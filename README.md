# Web Scraper for Amazon
# üìä Amazon Laptop Prices and Ratings Dashboard

This project is a **Streamlit** web application that provides interactive visualizations and insights into the prices and ratings of laptops listed on Amazon. The dashboard allows users to filter laptops based on price and rating, view different types of data visualizations, and perform sentiment analysis on reviews, if they exist.

## üöÄ Features

- **Price Range Filtering**: Filter laptops by selecting a price range.
- **Rating Range Filtering**: Filter laptops by selecting a rating range.
- **Top Value for Money Laptops**: See the top 10 laptops with the best value (highest rating per price).
- **Visualizations**:
  - **Price Distribution**: A histogram that shows the distribution of laptop prices.
  - **Word Cloud**: A word cloud generated from the product names of the laptops.
  - **Correlation Heatmap**: A heatmap showing the correlation between price and rating.
- **Download Filtered Data**: Download the filtered dataset as a CSV file.
- **Summary Metrics**: Average price and rating of the filtered laptops.
